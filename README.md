# Password Generator
This page is a random password generator (note: not secure!).

You'll be prompted for various criteria you want to include or exclude, and if at least
1 of those criteria are met, and the password length is determined to be
between 8-128 characters, then you, the user, will be given a randomly
generated password.

You can always refresh and change your criteria to receive
a new password that's more to your liking.
